# Prime Gym

Making my first project ever this has been my harderst task by far and most effort taking but i wanted to make Prime Gym visually simple and nothing hard to navigate.

Websites with lots of navigation is sometimes to hard to go through you end up loosing what you are looking for.

# UX 

View LIVE demo here! https://jamie-page.github.io/prime-gym/

ince this is hosted on GitHub, My database is non-functional. This means the sign up & contact form do not work! However if it was a real live website this would work.

When creating Prime Gym I wanted it to look smart with a single interactive header and a single interactive footer.

# Features 

I have a few features on my page including a Sign up box and a Join now box. However there not live. I got the header and Footer of a website and will credit them later down in the README.

I wanted to create my website but not to be tasking to read and look at thats why there isnt alot of context or information within my website. I wanted to keep the information simple as it is a gym website and not an Wiki Page.



 I have used bootstrap for using my .cols
